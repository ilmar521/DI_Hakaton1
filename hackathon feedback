Card Match Game
First of all wonderful job on your card game project!
The game is fully functional and well thought out. With different levels , and the option to match different ammount of cards!
I like how you declare all your DOM elements and variables at the beggining of the script & render the cards dynamically with DOM
manipulation and not HARD CODED in the html.
This is a great project and done very well.
Keep it up.
PS. The styling is excellent too- the animations when flipping cards.... A+!
